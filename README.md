How to use the phone conferencing room

The phone system of the university has the feature to put up conference rooms. For the time being only the audio option is available. It can be used from every phone using landline or mobile connection.

This conference room is bound to the direct number of me. I am free to open further rooms, as everybody is who has access to the phone configuration at https://osuc-fe.voip.uni-freiburg.de/openscapeuc . You need to open the account.
